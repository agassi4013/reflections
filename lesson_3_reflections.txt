When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When we want to sharing ideas

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because we might want to choose what we want to share and too many update on remote would consume time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks show the original owner while clones doesn't, so we use forks when we want to copy repository from others.
    Branches is used when we create some test version but not on the main version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can merge conflicts on local then push.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Use SVN or other version control softwares, may take time to learn, maybe there's some function not
    avaliable or different flow design.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When coperate with others, separate branch let others check your modification before apply to master.
    Directly in master may be easier to modify functions when changes doesn't need communications.
