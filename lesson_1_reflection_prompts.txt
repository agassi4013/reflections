How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easier to find some typo mistakes while adding new function.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can always restart from the history version which works correctly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing can avoid many redudant commit while saving automatically, 
    but choosing when to create acommit is sometimes tricky.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git mainly focus on version control of code, so many files are related. 
    In contrast, Google Docs saves many different types of data, it is more reasonable
    to treat each file separately beacause most of the data is not related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use 'git log' to search the target version and 'git diff' to view the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because we can go back to the previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use git to control version for projects.
